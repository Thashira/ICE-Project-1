# ICE Project 1

This is the first project created for training machine learning models, except YOLO. 

The project includes:
- `model.py` — the main ML model code
- `train/` — training dataset and scripts
- `test/` — test dataset and evaluation scripts

This repository is for educational purposes and experimenting with ML model training workflows.
